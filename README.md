# Atlantis-I-Payload
Payload code for the 2017 Atlantis I rocket. Developed for the IREC competition using the Teensy 3.5 microcontroller, BMP180, MPL115A2, and the Razor 9DOF AHRS IMU. (more to come)

Please follow the instructions given by the Teensy Drivers to load code onto the Teensy for the first time. To upload code to the IMU and GPS, an FTDI chip was used.

## Dependencies:

Arduino IDE 1.6.X (Will allow for higher versions as the Teensy drivers are updated)
Teensy Drivers (Most up to date version)
